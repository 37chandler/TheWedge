    "## Reflections\n",
    "My experience of the Wedge project was difficult, time-consuming, and educational. I finished Task Two and Task Three, which gave me a little confidence to complete Task One. By no means, are Task Two and Three a walk in the park, but there’s some guidance from previous assignments. \n",
    "\t<p>I realized that the main way to see if Task One worked, was by running the next two tasks and evaluating their output. Then, if it wasn’t close, I would go back and tweak Task One. However, each new upload of Task One took about 1 hour and 20 minutes. I would try to note what I had changed each time, because sometimes it would make it all worse. There were a few odd issues I tried my best to remedy, and I believe my final outputs are so close—besides the null value.</p>\n",
    "\t<p>Despite all the struggle, I feel like I have learned a lot about data engineering and processing data into a database. Which is huge. I am a big believer in learn by doing.  </p>"
